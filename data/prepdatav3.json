Throughout this past year you have introduced us all to your artistic skills and inspired many of us to explore our own artistic skills, beginner or former artist. You've introduced new media through the video games you have played, the songs you have sung, or the artists you look up to yourself. All of this in addition to fostering a welcoming environment to further grow a good community and help future takodachis find their passion. Thank you.","image":"146.png"},{"user":"Uni88","icon":"Takodachi","message":"Happy Inaversary Inaaaaaaaa! Wahn Year Down More to come. I'll forever be a Takodachi to see you on this journey.

And even though I'm more like a distant cousin nobody even knows about, I'm proud to be part of this family. It may have only been a year, but being a tako has changed my life for the better in a lot of ways. Thank you!","image":"121.png"},{"user":"P-Apple","icon":"Takomfy","message":"HAPPY INAVERSARY!!!

You inspired me to work on art more regularly! 2020 was a rough year for me but your puns, passion, & overall adorable personality comforted me many times when I really needed it.

A WAH is fitting at the moment. It’s been only one year with you and HoloMyth, but everything in my life has become so much more bright and eventful. I’ve regained passion in things I loved and gained new motivation to face the things I hate. It’s all thanks to a certain eldritch priestess.
