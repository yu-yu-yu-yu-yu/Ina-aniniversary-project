But it‚Äôs when you, I guess somehow just have to step back and be like, ‚ÄòThat has happened. You gotta admit it. It happened, it‚Äôs done. You can‚Äôt go back. What can I do now?‚Äô Hahaha. It doesn‚Äôt mean you wanna forget the past, you just acknowledged that its happened and it‚Äôs there and you‚Äôve presented it to yourself and be like, ‚ÄòOkay. Do I want this to continue? Or do I want this to change?‚Äô Humu humu.‚Äù\n\nNot gonna lie, looking back, when I was just a clips watcher, one of the reasons I started watching you regularly besides I really love how chill your streams are, is because of how wise your words are. Your mindset inspires me to better myself, especially when it comes to controlling my emotions.\n\nThere are so many Ina of the Mountain (or, in this stream, Ina of the Onigiri) quotes, but I chose this one because it resonates with me deeply (and kinda a hard slap for me in a way, haha). As an overthinker, I often doubt myself and get demotivated to do things, especially when trying new stuffs, because I really fear them. But you taught me to just take the first step, have confidence, and if things don‚Äôt go perfectly, learn from it and improve for next time. As life is all about learning.\n\nI just want to sincerely thank you, Ina, for inspiring us to become better versions of ourselves. Be proud of all you‚Äôve done. You, Myth, and everyone have never failed to bring smiles to our faces. So, Happy 4th Anniversary! Here‚Äôs to more amazing times!\n\n(PS: Please remember to take care of yourself too. We takos sometimes do worry about your sleep schedule and whether you‚Äôre eating well, lol. Love ya, our tako priestess!)",

I actually couldn't believe it, since I submitted it quite late, and it was just a cute/silly thing, but Ina liked it! Ina and the Takos love for cookies is eternal and infinite; the cookie dress sure looked edible, heh.\n\nAlso, when she performed \"~(if ~Hitori Omou~)\" during her 3D showcase, I was actually stunned, shocked, I exploded, melted, died, and revived! FE is one of my favorite franchises, and I love that song so much. Seeing Ina dance and sing it so gracefully, so adorably... was incredible.\n\nMan, I love Ina. She's really a great inspiration for me, and I'm sure she is for all of us Takos. She brought us together, and gave us so many fun moments. Our priestess is amazing!\n\nHappy 4th Anniversary!!",
